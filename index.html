                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            On May 3, 2021, I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh
                            with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and a minor in
                            Computer Science! As a very recent grad, I'm both excited and nervous
                            to see where life will take me next. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the
                            circumstances of living life and I can only hope to learn how to navigate
                            our new reality.<br><br>I'm originally from Northern California, about an hour
                            outside of San Francisco, however I've spent the past 3-4 years in
                            Pittsburgh, PA studying Electrical Engineering at the Swanson School of
                            Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. Through summer research and
                            internship experiences, I've been given the opportunity to travel to other
                            parts of the U.S. and have gained an appreciation of travel that has been
                            momentarily put on hold due to COVID-19.<br><br>I hope to go back to school
                            in a couple of years to pursue a Master's degree in either Electrical
                            Engineering or Computer Science after gaining some hands-on experience in a
                            workplace setting. I'm aiming towards developing my programming skills and
                            knowledge about information security and cybersecurity. My last semester of
                            university coursework sparked a greater interest in the intersection of hardware
                            and software and I look forward to learning more about this field through
                            real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, IoT, and network security.
